        <p>Hi and thanks for coming by! A little about me, if a little randomly: I'm an artist 
        turned web designer. For the last 12 years I've been the art teacher for elementary 
        students at Calabasas School in Rio Rico, Arizona. My favorite joke is in spanish, 
        because it's the only joke I ever understood in spanish. My current game addiction 
        is called Township, what is it about farming and city planning that hooks me? And
        something funny, my parents informed me I have a new baby brother in the form of 
        four furry legs named Toby.
        <br />

        I hope the best for your adventures in the online world. If I can help in any way,
        we can talk about what you need for your business, organization, or personal goals.
        The options are endless in what's available for connecting to the online community 
        and sharing your message. We'll research and tailor things that best suit your time
        and budget.
        <br />
        <br />
        Take a look at my portfolio for some examples of my work and style. Send me a message
        if you'd like to learn, create, or update something new for yourself, business, 
        or organization.
        </p>
